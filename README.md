# Kannada-MNIST-Autoencoder
This is a small machine learning project that I am working on and learning about. This dataset contains images similar to MNIST dataset, but for the kannada language. You can read more about the paper [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/higgstachyon/kannada-mnist) .<br>
In this project, I have mainly used 3 methods to construct the AutoEncoder Architecture, all the details which are demonstrated in the notebook.

There are a lot of challenges that are proposed in the dataset problem. This notebook is in regards with the development of an Autoencoder capable of generating near accurate recreation of numeric digits of the kannada language. The data is in the same format of 28 x 28 pixels greyscale images.
